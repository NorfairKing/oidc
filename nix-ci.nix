# NixCI configuration.
#
# NixCI evaluates this file when it exists and only falls back to the flake's
# 'nix-ci' output when it does not, so this file is the whole configuration:
# anything left out here is not configured at all.
#
# It also has to be self-contained.  NixCI reads it straight out of the forge
# without cloning, so an import of another file is rejected rather than read.
